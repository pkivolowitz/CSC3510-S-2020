# CSC 3510 - SPRING - 2020

The syllabus is located [here](./SYLLABUS.md).

Installation of the VM is described [here](./INSTALLATION.md).

I have come to the conclusion that this course (in so far as assembly language is concerned) is actually not that hard at all! *(Easy for me to say, right!)* What makes it hard is if you are unable to put aside all the whizzy new fangled contrivances you have become accustomed to. Allow yourself to open up to the reality and you already know 98 percent of what you need to know to master assembly language - just that all the crap on top has been boiled away.

I have also come to the conclusion that this course (in so far as parallel programming is concerned) is also actually not hard at all! *(Easy for me to say, right!)* What make it hard is your potential to be unable to put aside the notion that one thing happens at a time.

Bottom line: The more you resist relaxing and thinking expansively, the harder the course will be. The more you let your preconceived notions go, the easier it will be.

Start digesting [this](./DONT_PANIC).
