# Project 1 - FizzBuzz

You thought you were through with FizzBuzz? Nope.

In this first project, you must code CS 1's FizzBuzz program.

For the numbers 0 through 99 inclusive:

* print the number if it is neither divisible by 3 nor by 5.
* print Fizz if the number is divisible by 3 and not 5.
* print Buzz if the number is divisible by 5 and not 3.
* print FizzBuzz if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

## There is no modulus instruction in ArmV8

Use this instead:

```text
	udiv	x2, x0, x1
	msub 	x3, x2, x1, x0
```

This implements `x0 % x1` with the remainder in `x3`.

## Printing

Remember that `cin` and `cout` are not available. Instead you will be using C equivalents.

Printing "Fizz", "Buzz" and "FizzBuzz" requires no formatting so `puts` can be used at your option.

Printing numbers requires formatting so use `printf`.

## Building

Suppose your code is called `fb.s`. Then building is:

```text
gcc -g fb.s
```

The `-g` option specifies that debugging is enabled.

## Running

```text
./a.out
```

## Debugging

If you need to use the debugger:

```text
gdb a.out
```

You will need to learn the rest...

## Prototyping in C to see generated code

Prototype in C if you like.

If your goal is to learn from the C compiler's version, your time would better be spent (and you will learn more by) coding the assembly language version yourself.

## Partner rules

It is important you each get this down as it lays the basis for your future understanding of assembly language. Therefore, this project will be done **SOLO**.

## Hand in

Only the `.s` file.
